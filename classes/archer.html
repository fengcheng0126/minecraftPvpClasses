            <p>The archer class is a support type class that can attack from far away without taking any damage other than  
                arrows from an enemy. The stats are very low, but the range is important and the evolutions are quite 
                devastating. Make sure to make use of any special arrows and if you want to, drink a potion ofnight vision. 
                The archer has a wooden sword just in case they get chased but it is the best to stay out of the way of the 
                warriors and meelee classes. With 20 cobblestone and ladders, you can build a makeshift archer tower and have an 
                engineer or a person with a pickaxe break it for you.

            <p>The ranger is a tier 1 class that is focused on quick attacks and attacks that do moderate damage, such as firework 
                rockets and tipped arrows and power enchanted bows. They also have infinity on their bows, so they can do good 
                damage. A ranger can hide, so they have potions such as leaping II and speed II to get away to do so. They have 
                2 sets of leather armor, one is normal and the other is green leather armor so that they can hide in trees and 
                grass. They have spectral arrows to mark opponents and tipped arrows of weakness to make them more prone to 
                attacks. Lastly, since the ranger has only leather armor, they have the thorns enchantment plus the unbreaking 
                one both at level II to defend itself.

            <p>The sniper has a powerful shot. Only the best aimers should play as a sniper, as it has far range and powerful 
                damage but not much other power. Its bow is enchanted as power IV and has Flame. Just hang out and shoot people 
                with the special arrows. If absolutely needed, hit people with your fist and if on a tower, knock them off.
