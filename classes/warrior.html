            <p>The warrior class is a versatile meelee troop, that can very easily deal damage to enemies. It wields a
                sword
                and has medium armor, such as chainmail peices. It is focused on damaging the opponent and does not
                really have tricks. It has a sword and a few other weapons and items. If you'd like to, you can give the
                warrior a
                potion of regeneration. As said, it is very versatile and can be used in pretty much any meelee combat
                situation.
                Try to go in the midst of battle with your Stone sword to get the best results.

            <p>The knight, a defensive upgrade of a warrior, is dressed for defence with iron armor and a shield but
                only an
                iron sword. Go defensive and stay at the edge of a brawl for your iron sword won't do much against the
                other
                classes. However, the knight plays the waiting game, with golden apples and iron armor. Plus, knights
                can have
                totems of undying to give extra hitpoints. Just slowly wear down your enemies and you can win. On a
                team,
                knights do the absolute best with an offensive class and ranged classes. Finally, if you are on a team
                of
                support and ranged classes, try to tank most of the damage so that the supports can help you with ranged
                attacks.

            <p>The gladiator is a mainly offensive class that has more reach than the knight class. It should be noted
                that
                it has a strength potion so you can be a powerful fighter without needing much defence. Also, the
                gladiator has a leaping and swiftness potion for dodging, as the main form of defence. The weapon of the
                gladiator is a sweeping edge I diamond sword for the medium range on offence. If used in a team, the
                best
                combos would be a mage evolution, as they have Healing: potions as well as other effects. Another combo
                would
                be the gladiator-knight combo, as the knight can soak up damage while the gladiator attacks. You can
                not have any armor other than leather, but that does not stop you from dominating. The best tactic for
                the
                gladiator is to quickly damage, and then drop back to let the other teammate(s) pvp.
