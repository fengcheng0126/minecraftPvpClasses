            <p>The warrior class is a versatile meelee troop, that can very easily deal damage to enemies. It wields a sword 
                and has medium armor, such as gold and chainmail peices. It is focused on damaging the opponent and does not 
                really have tricks. It has a sword and a few other weapons and items. If you'd like to, you can give the warrior a 
                potion of regeneration. As said, it is very versatile and can be used in pretty much any meelee combat situation. 
                Try to go in the midst of battle with your Stone sword to get the best results.
