            <p>The warrior class is a versatile meelee troop, that can very easily deal damage to enemies. It wields a sword 
                and has medium armor, such as gold and chainmail peices. It is focused on damaging the opponent and does not 
                really have tricks. It has a sword and a few other weapons and items. If you'd like to, you can give the warrior a 
                potion of regeneration. As said, it is very versatile and can be used in pretty much any meelee combat situation. 
                Try to go in the midst of battle with your Stone sword to get the best results.

            <p>The knight, a defensive upgrade of a warrior, is dressed for defence with iron armor and a shield but only an 
                iron sword. Go defensive and stay at the edge of a brawl for your iron sword won't do much against the other 
                classes. However, the knight plays the waiting game, with golden apples and iron armor. Plus, knights can have 
                totems of undying to give extra hitpoints. Just slowly wear down your enemies and you can win. On a team, 
                knights do the absolute best with an offensive class and ranged classes. Finally, if you are on a team of 
                support and ranged classes, try to tank most of the damage so that the supports can help you with ranged 
                attacks.
